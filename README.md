# shotdeck_scraper
It's a Scrapy(Python) based scraper that extracts Images and Videos URLs from Shotdeck which is the largest collection of fully searchable high-definition movie images in the world.
NOTE: There were no links to Videos directly, I had to search a trick manually which you can find in the code if you're good enough at programming. But it's ok if you don't ;)

#Dependencies:
- Python
- Scrapy

# Instructions: 
1) Enter the account cridentials at line. 20 and 21
2) Change the category URL in line no. 28
3) Run the script and it will generate the output file.
